### Procedures to run multiple attempts
1.copy config1.txt and rename it, feel free to change the parameters inside the txt files,
for instance one can get config2.txt
2.in command window, enter the location file of OSU_Smartpong-master, using python
pong.py config2.txt so that one can use config2.txt to run the attempt. Then one needs to 
save the data and path.
3.to try another attempt using the command window, one needs to repeat the step 2(assign to
another config file), so that multiple attempts at the same time are allowed.
4.still working on how to diplay two different correlations.
